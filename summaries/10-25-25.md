# Summary 10-25-25
We discussed some key developmental areas. Firstly, we talked about the process of connecting some more front end and 
backend components, ensuring that data flows smoothly between the two. This included identifying potential issues and
planning some tests. We also talked about cohesiveness in design for our website and tweaked some shades and colors to
ensure consistent styling. Finally, we discussed the implementation of "Cooking Mode." The team will explore the design
layout, functionality, and integration plan for this feature in the next step of our development cycle.
